# Language Learning tools

This repository contains some tools that have helped me in my language learning journey.

Most of the code here is vibe coded, and not meant to be used by anyone else. But if you find it useful, feel free to use it or contribute!

# Ideas

 - Take the Language Transfer course audio files, transcribe them, and create Anki decks of all the new vocabulary introduced in each lesson
 - To do this, we will use OpenAI's WhisperX for transcription, and some LLM API to extract the new vocabulary and examples

 - There are anki decks of the top 1000 spanish words (or so), but they are not super high quality. The one I'm using is also only in one direction (Spanish -> English)
 - Ideally, I would like to add the other direction, and german translations (my native language).
 - So I take every word pair in the deck, and use an LLM to annotate it for quality and generate more accurate translations and example sentences. And reverse translation direction.

## Costs

I used deep seek reasoner for most tasks because of its cheap price.

- Transcribing of language transfer course was free (local gpu)
- Extracting vocabulary from the language transfer transcripts cost around 40 cents
- Cleaning up the anki deck and adding german translations for the top 1000 words cost around 2 dollars

## transcriptions

Download Language Transfer course from [here](https://downloads.languagetransfer.org/spanish/spanish.zip), and unzip the contents into `./data/lt`

Add huggingface token in `.env.example` and rename to `.env`

`pip3 install torch torchvision torchcodec --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 src/transcribe_folder.py`

`python3 src/extract_vocab_from_transcripts.py`

## Anki deck cleanup and enrichment

TODO put link to anki deck
I found some anki deck with the 1000 most common spanish words, but it wasn't the highest quality, and only contained spanish -> english translations. So I used an LLM to clean up the translations, add german translations, and add example sentences.

`python3 src/extract_from_anki.py`

`python3 src/calc_anki_json_stats.py`

`python3 src/make_anki_deck.py`
## 🗞️ BBC Noticias Bot

A daily Spanish language learning bot: fetches BBC Mundo RSS → selects the most relevant story via AI → simplifies the article for B1 learners (with English word translations) → sends it to Discord or Telegram.

### Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get an OpenRouter key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

3. For Discord: add a webhook to your channel (Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks)

4. For Telegram: create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get your chat ID

### Run

**One-shot (manual):**
```bash
python -m src.bbc_noticias.bot
```

**Dry run (no messages sent):**
```bash
DRY_RUN=true python -m src.bbc_noticias.bot
```

**Scheduled (Docker):**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The container runs daily by default. Configure `SCHEDULE_HOURS` to change the interval.

**Scheduled (without Docker):**
```bash
python -m src.bbc_noticias.bot --loop --interval 24
```
